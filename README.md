## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project

- **Theme : Work from Home** Every tech firm uses multiple apps to help employees keep track of their progress. Since we are using separate ecosystems to do so, there is a lack of integration between the different ecosystems, which could hinder workflow and cause unnecessary problems.
